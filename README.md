# GBDX-Ebola
Using GBDX and DigitalGlobe's open data to find areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that are at an elevated risk of an ebola outbreak.

The original Jupyter Notebook can be found at:
https://notebooks.geobigdata.io/hub/notebooks/5b2d45122c7831647a30718f?tab=code
To view the notebook, you will need to create a GDBX account.

I've included a pdf of the notebook, but the interactive maps do not show.
